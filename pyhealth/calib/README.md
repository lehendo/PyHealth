# PyHealth Calibration Module

This module contains post-hoc uncertainty quantification methods for healthcare AI models, including model calibration methods and prediction set constructors.

## Model Calibration Methods

Model calibration methods adjust predicted probabilities to better reflect true confidence levels.

### Temperature Scaling

**Modes**: `multiclass`, `multilabel`, `binary`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.calibration.TemperatureScaling`

Temperature scaling (also known as Platt scaling for binary classification) is a simple yet effective calibration method that scales logits by a learned temperature parameter.

### Histogram Binning

**Modes**: `multiclass`, `multilabel`, `binary`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.calibration.HistogramBinning`

Histogram binning is a non-parametric calibration method that bins predictions and adjusts probabilities within each bin.

### Dirichlet Calibration

**Modes**: `multiclass`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.calibration.DirichletCalibration`

Dirichlet calibration learns a matrix transformation of logits with regularization for improved calibration.

### KCal (Kernel-Based Calibration)

**Modes**: `multiclass`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.calibration.KCal`

KCal uses kernel density estimation on embeddings for full multiclass calibration. The model must support `embed=True` in forward pass.

## Prediction Set Methods

Prediction set methods provide set-valued predictions with statistical coverage guarantees.

### LABEL (Least Ambiguous Set-valued Classifier)

**Modes**: `multiclass`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.predictionset.LABEL`

LABEL is a conformal prediction method that constructs prediction sets with bounded error levels. Supports both marginal and class-conditional coverage.

### SCRIB (Set-classifier with Class-specific Risk Bounds)

**Modes**: `multiclass`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.predictionset.SCRIB`

SCRIB controls class-specific risk while minimizing prediction set ambiguity through optimized class-specific thresholds.

### FavMac (Fast Value-Maximizing Prediction Sets)

**Modes**: `multilabel`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.predictionset.FavMac`

FavMac constructs prediction sets that maximize value while controlling cost/risk, particularly useful for multilabel classification with asymmetric costs.

### CovariateLabel (Covariate Shift Adaptive Conformal)

**Modes**: `multiclass`

**Class**: `pyhealth.calib.predictionset.CovariateLabel`

CovariateLabel extends LABEL to handle covariate shift between calibration and test distributions using likelihood ratio weighting.
